# About Me

Hello! I'm Liu Ziwen, currently advancing the field of AI as a Postdoctoral researcher at the School of Artificial Intelligence, University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). My research is passionately centered around representation learning, explainable AI, information theory, and the transformative domain of medical image processing.

My academic journey commenced with a bachelor's degree from the School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC, 2018). There, I immersed myself in the study of non-negative matrix factorization methods, which laid a solid foundation for my later research endeavors.

The quest for deeper knowledge took me to the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences for my doctoral studies, where I had the privilege of being mentored by Professors Han Congying and Guo Tiande. Under their guidance, I specialized in information-theoretic-based representation learning methods, uncovering novel insights in representation learning through the application of information theory principles like information maximization criteria and the information bottleneck principle. My research journey extended into crucial areas such as disentangled representation learning, contrastive learning methods, and graph-based representation learning.

Currently, in my postdoctoral phase, I am honored to collaborate with Professor Yang Ge, further deepening my expertise and research impact. My passion for pushing the limits of artificial intelligence is unwavering, especially in addressing complex challenges in medical image processing. If you're intrigued by my research or interested in potential collaborations in these exciting fields, feel free to reach out. Let's explore the frontiers of AI innovation together!
